About me

I had always been infatuated with technology.
My first interation with things behind the scenes however, was in highschool.
In a special project, we were taught about design and programming.
There was something in between the two and I wanted to be a part of that.
With that in mind, I studied computer science for my bachelor's degree.
It was very helpful, but it wasn't enough, I wanted more training in a specific field.
That's why I chose to do a master's focused on human-centered computing.

I touched web design in one of my student jobs during undergrad and I loved it.

I use technology, and only more and more people are going to be using technology.
